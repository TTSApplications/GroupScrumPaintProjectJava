	Yesterday :I found out about the setId and getId during my research and used those now.
	Today     :Working on highlighting buttons when they are selected.
	Obstacles :Had to do some research but quickly found out about ToggleButton's within
	JavaFX that toggle and you can set them in ToggeGroup's.

	Today     :I am working on filler styles.

	Yesterday :Finished USERSTORY6
	Today     :Users uploaded broken version of project with missing elements after 
	failed implementation of resorting a merge conflict.

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday :Code was broken.
	Today     :Trying to find member with working version of code. Found member with working code.

	with reliability.

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday :Accomplished Line Thickness Changer using User input.
	Today     :Trying to figure out how to implement each thickness to individual shapes.
	Obstacles :I believe it may have to do with the way we are implementing the Circle and 
	drawing it on screen itself. On the other hand, I am also trying to see if I can 
	accomplish individuality with the way it is already implemented.

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on creating individuality.
	Today     :I solved it, it had to do with the fact, that we weren't storing values

	use the circle properly. Trying to figure out how DrawingCommand can be used properly in our
	program.
	Obstacles :We rely on alot of local variables when drawing shapes. So is there a way I can 
	make those public and somewhere else?

Nov 13, 2018
