TYPE     : USER STORY 1 : lynesdan
NAME     : Draw Circle
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To click the center of the circle, drag, and release to specify
           a circle to be drawn in the current style.
SO THAT  : I can add circles to my canvas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYPE     : USER STORY 2 : diazjaze
NAME     : Draw Circle Feedback
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 2 
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
AS A     : user
I WANT   : As a user is specifying a Circle, during the drag, a 'current'
           circle should be on display. As the user drags, the 'current'
           circle changes in real time so that a circle is drawn with
           centre at users initial circle click, with radius out to
           the current dragged mouse position.
SO THAT  : I can see the circle I am about to build on release of the mouse
           button.

TYPE     : BUG 1 : laplacaa
NAME     : Icons instead of text for drawing mode selection
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 1 (can be easily updated)
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
ISSUE    : Would be nice to have icons instead of "Circle", "Rectangle", ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 2 : laplacaa
NAME     : Drawing selection mode not indicated
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : - Can be omitted but we decided to make selection more visible
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
ISSUE    : Currently ,you can't tell which mode "Circle", "Rectangle", ...
           is currently selected. Is JButton correct, is there a way
           to highlight the currently selected mode?

TYPE     : BUG 4 : diazjaze
NAME     : Architecture behind Model is poor
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : after all User Stories completed
ESTIMATE : by end of week 2
ISSUE    : Having a list of different types of drawable things in the
           model is cumbersome. In fact, it is currently incorrect, with
           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.
           Consider some design patterns, or change of responsibility
           here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 5 : diazjaze
NAME     : Squiggle is broken
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Squiggles are connected to each other by a straight line. Each drag
		   of the mouse should be a separate squiggle. Possibly
           the issue is with the representation of the squiggles in the Model.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 6 : lynesdan
NAME     : Circle drawing is broken
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 1 (done in lab)
ESTIMATE : Day 1
ISSUE    : The first click should specify the center of the circle, with
           a drag for the radius. This is not the case in the current
           implementation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 8 : diazjaze
NAME     : Implement Poly Line
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 8 (completed with the other user stories)
ESTIMATE : close to end of week 1
ISSUE    : Polyline hasn't been implemented.
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To click to make points on the canvas that are connected by
straight lines, in the order I click.
SO THAT  : I can add polylines to my canvas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 9 : diazjaze
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing drawing mode is poor
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : can be implemented before bug 7,8,10
ESTIMATE : beginning of sprint 3
ISSUE    : A better architecture behind selecting a drawing mode can be created 
by implementing the Factory Design Pattern as follows:

The factory design pattern should be used by the paint buttons. 
The factory is responsible for creating different ShapeManipulatorStrategy 
instances (see BUG 2.4). That is, when a button is pressed, the appropriate 
ShapeManipulatorStrategy is created and installed in the PaintPanel. 
Note that you can associate text with a button, even if you 
display an ImageIcon. The string attached to the button causes the right choice 
of object creation.

TYPE     : USER STORY 3 : lynesdan
NAME     : Draw Rectangle
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To click on one corner of a rectangle, drag, and release to 
		   specify two corners of a rectangle to be drawn in the current style.
SO THAT  : I can add rectangles to my canvas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 4 : lynesdan
NAME     : Draw Rectangle Feedback
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE : by end of week 1
AS A     : user
I WANT   : Similarly to Draw Circle Feedback, display the rectangle in mid construction.
SO THAT  : I can see the rectangle I am about to build on release of the mouse button.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 3 : hassa153 / laplacaa (implementation & design)
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : early after all user stories completed
ESTIMATE : by beginning of week 3
ISSUE    : Code is not modular and is difficult to expand. Need a better
           architecture behind selecting a drawing mode, and handling
           the drawing events. Consider some design patterns here.
           Refactor ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel to get rid of the
           'if' blocks in the PaintPanel mouse event code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 7 : diazjaze
NAME     : Architecture for drawing shapes can be improved
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : 7th in the bug list
ESTIMATE : by end of week 3
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design 
Pattern to draw shapes as follows:

The PaintModel should use the command design pattern. 
That is, each shape knows how to draw itself, so there is a single list of 
DrawingCommands maintained by the PaintModel and used by the PaintPanel.
repaint() simply asks the PaintModel to ask command to execute(g).
The simplest way to make this happen is to make each shape implement the 
DrawingCommand interface which requires execute(g) to be implemented.
Well sort of.

NOTE: The PaintModel does know how to logically draw itself, so does
know about strokes and pen colors etc. Depending on how much you want
to split off the logical from the GUI, it may not have to know how to 
draw on the screen. This is a subtle difference. For example, the
following logically describes a scene, without actually knowing
how to draw it on the screen ...

Color = green
Fill = off
Border = on
BorderWidth = 10
Circle radius 10 at 12,15
Color = red
Fill = on
FillColor = black
Border = on
BorderWidth = 7
Square width 20 at 100,200

If you want to build a more 'logical' PaintModel, you can consider ...

1) Create a mirror hierarchy for Shape, this mirror hirerachy 
has things like DrawableCircle which has a Circle. The DrawableCircle
knows how to draw the instance of Circle it holds. Each Shape will
still need information about its color, and stroke, one way or another.

OR

2) Lookup and apply the Visitor design pattern to the more logical
PaintModel.

TYPE     : USER STORY 9 : diazjaze
NAME     : undo/redo
OWNER    : diazjaze
PRIORITY : last
ESTIMATE : can complete in a few hours
AS A     : user
I WANT   : Click on undo and redo in the menu
SO THAT  : performed Drawing Commands on the canvas can be undone, 
			and undone commands can be redone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 8 : laplacaa
NAME     : Architecture for handling shape modifiers can be improved 
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : omitted
ESTIMATE : -
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design 
Pattern to handle changes to the graphics contex such as changing drawing 
color, stroke width etc. You can accomplished this by wrapping the changes
to the graphics context in a DrawingCommand. This way these changes can be
added to the Bug 2.1 DrawingCommand list. That is, these new types of 
DrawingCommands appear on PaintPanel's list right along side 
the Shape type DrawingCommands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 10 : laplacaa
NAME     : Architecture behind creating shape instances is poor
OWNER    : Prof
PRIORITY : last - omitted
ESTIMATE : 3 days
ISSUE    : A better architecture for creating shape instances so that it is 
more flexible, and easier to work with can be created using the Strategy Design 
pattern as follows:

Create class/abstract class/interface  ShapeManipulatorStrategy as well 
as subclasses/implementators for each type of Shape. Call these the
concrete ShapeNamipulatorStrategies

The concrete ShapeManipulatorStrategies are responsible for 

1. Creating instances of Shape and putting them on top of 
   the PaintModel command stack.

2. Understanding how mouse events modify the shape at the top of the 
   PaintModel command stack.

3. Calling the PaintPanel repaint at appropriate times.

This strategy can be put in place either by having PaintPanel's mouse 
events forwarded through PaintPanel into the current strategy, or by 
simply switching the PaintPanel's event handlers as appropriate.
